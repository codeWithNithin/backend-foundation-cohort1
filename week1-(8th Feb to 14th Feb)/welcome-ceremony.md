# How to learn in an effective way.

- Our brain consumes or processes content in 1GB.
- we take notes by writing on notebook.
- dont see content as webseries or Netflix.
- change the mindset while watching educational videos to take notes (notes can be digital or hard copy).
- if u dont take notes, u will not remember anything.

# Where to take notes?

- using pen paper, ipad, or digital notes.

# why digital notes?

- we dont go into rabbit hole.

# Obsidian app - Note taking app (Rakesh sir's personal preference).

- we can take notes.
- we can do linking inorder to avoid rabbit hole problem.
