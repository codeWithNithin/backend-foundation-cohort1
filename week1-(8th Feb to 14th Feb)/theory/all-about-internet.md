- QNA.

# Some terminologies

### What is a network?

- Its a group or system of people or items interconnected with each other.

### What is computer network?

- It is a group of computers connected each other with cables or wires.

### What is Internet ?

- Its a network of computer networks.

### Why Internet was created ?

- In russia, there are forests, inside which u can see 100s of bunkers present. it was created during world war 2. between german and soviet union.

##### 1945 - World war 2 started

- When USA bombed nuclear on japan,the sovient union informed USA that USA didnt informed them about nuclear bomb.

NOTE: Before that bomb moment, USA was with Sovient Union.

##### 1957 - Sputnik satelite Launch

- After this satelite launch, USA taught that they will be behind in this space related research thing.

##### 1958 - USA Created agency called ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)

- To fund those who are working on some technical projects.
- Its managed by defences or military ppl.
- It started many projects
- In those ERA, computers where very huge with big rooms and all.
- During that time, only 1 user could have used it, using punch cards and all.
- all computers were centralized and used only for research purposes.

##### 1962 - Cuban missle crisis

- USA started thinking about what happens if there is a problem in data comm.
  Computers where very huge and expensive. user should have to come to one place and access it.

- They started thinking about decentralized and if comm lost,then there should be a way to transfer it anyhow.

##### 1966 - ARPANET project started

- there were 2 scientists they developed packet switching concept.
- Packet switchig is the reason of modern internet usage.
- in packet switching we divide the whole data into chunks and then send to destination
- There is a way to send packets, each packets will go in different routes to reach destination
- By electronic theroy, if there are 2 devices at long distance, then there could be possiblity of singal drop.
- We are not sending whole data, but we divide this whole data into chunks and send them through check points.

##### 1969 - First message was sent

- message sent was login
- but only Lo was recieved.
- message was sent at UCLA by SRI
- Both has computers and ARPAnet connection.

##### 1971 - text msg where possible to sent in USA within Universties

- Also email was also possible to sent

##### 1973 - Extended ARPANET to UK.

- This time messages were sent outside US.

##### 1974 - One paper was researched - TCP protocol

##### 1983 - ARPANET was usng a protocol called NCP.

- a host to host protocol
- packet switching was there in NCP.
- Routing was not straightforward.
- one more problem was: it was host to host.
- Then they started using TCP.
- This was the reason for birth of the internet.

##### 1st JAN 1983 - Birthdate of internet.

### OSI model

### TCP/IP model
